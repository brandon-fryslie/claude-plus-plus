# CLAUDE.md

## Project Setup Detection

**PRIORITY CHECK**: If `PROJECT_SETUP.md` exists in the project root, IMMEDIATELY begin the interactive project setup wizard defined in that file. Do not proceed with any other tasks until the wizard is complete and the file is deleted.

## Agent Workflow Overview

Repeat until `.agent_projects/<active-project>/TODO.md` is empty:

1. Plan → `/plan-next-step` selects highest-priority backlog task.
2. Implement → `/implement-item` implements selected task.
3. Test → `/retest` runs tests, identifies and fixes regressions.
4. Refactor → `/refactor` simplifies code, improves tests, reduces complexity.
5. Validate UX → `/validate-ux` ensures intuitive documented user flows.
6. Track → `/status` updates project STATUS.md and repository-level milestones.

Switch to Stabilization Mode if stability KPI falls below threshold:
- Prioritize regression fixes, test failures, and complexity reduction.

## Requirements Analysis Protocol

**CRITICAL**: Before implementing any feature request, ALWAYS follow this protocol to prevent requirements misalignment:

### 1. Requirements Conflict Detection
When encountering a request, check for these common conflict patterns:

**Pattern A: Existing vs. Specified**
- User says: "implement [feature]" or "make [component] functional"
- Existing code already exists for that component
- **STOP**: Existing code may use different architecture/approach than what's actually wanted

**Pattern B: General vs. Specific**
- Requirements contain both vague language ("make it functional") AND detailed technical specs
- **STOP**: These often represent different approaches

**Pattern C: Technology Stack Mismatches**
- Existing code uses one tech stack (custom CSS, vanilla JS)
- Requirements specify different tech stack (Tailwind, specific libraries)
- **STOP**: Don't substitute technologies without explicit permission

### 2. Mandatory Clarification Questions
When ANY of the above patterns detected, MUST ask before proceeding:

```
I see [specific conflict]. Before implementing, I need to clarify:

Option A: Enhance existing [component] with [current approach]
Option B: Replace with [specified requirements approach]

Which approach should I take?

Also, I notice [technology/architecture differences]. Should I:
- Use existing [current tech] OR specified [required tech]?
- Keep existing positioning/layout OR implement exact specifications?
```

### 3. Specification Priority Rules
When detailed technical specifications exist:

1. **Specifications are AUTHORITATIVE** - implement exactly as written
2. **Don't rationalize alternatives** - follow specs even if existing code seems "better"
3. **Don't add enhancements** during initial implementation
4. **Match ALL specified technologies** - don't substitute

### 4. Implementation Validation Checkpoints
Before major implementation decisions:

```
CHECKPOINT 1 - Requirements Understanding:
"Based on specs, I understand you want [X]. Is this correct?"

CHECKPOINT 2 - Approach Clarification:
"I see existing code does [Y], but specs call for [X]. Should I replace existing?"

CHECKPOINT 3 - Technology Stack:
"Requirements specify [tech stack]. Should I use this instead of existing [other stack]?"
```

### 5. User Prompting Guidance
Help users provide clearer requirements by suggesting:

**When user says "make X functional":**
```
I see X exists but isn't working as expected. To help me understand what you need:

- Should I enhance the existing X approach?
- Or do you have specific requirements for how X should work?
- Are there any technical constraints (positioning, technologies, etc.)?
```

**When user provides detailed specs:**
```
I see detailed technical specifications. To confirm:
- These specifications should be followed exactly? 
- Should I replace any existing similar functionality?
- Are the specified technologies (CSS framework, libraries) required?
```

### 6. Implementation Order - Spec Compliance First

**ALWAYS follow this sequence**:

1. **Minimal Viable Specification**: Build exactly what's specified, nothing more
2. **Validation**: Confirm with user that basic spec is met
3. **Enhancement**: Only add features if explicitly requested

**Never assume** that additional features are wanted, even if they seem "obviously useful."

### 7. Recognizing User Intent Mismatches

**Red Flags that indicate user might not realize they're requesting different approaches:**

- User says "make functional" but existing code is partially functional
- User provides detailed specs but doesn't explicitly say "replace existing"
- User asks for "refinement" but specs describe completely different architecture
- User doesn't mention existing code when requesting features

**Response**: Explicitly surface the potential mismatch rather than making assumptions.

### 8. Debugging Communication Failures

**When user says implementation is wrong, immediately check:**

1. **Did I follow specifications exactly?** (Most common failure)
2. **Did I ask clarifying questions when conflicts were detected?**
3. **Did I assume enhancements were wanted?**
4. **Did I substitute technologies without permission?**
5. **Did I prioritize existing code over specifications?**

**Recovery Process:**
1. Acknowledge the specific mismatch
2. Explain why the wrong choice was made
3. Offer to implement the correct solution
4. Update CLAUDE.md with lessons learned

### 9. User Education - Helping Users Give Better Requirements

**Proactively help users by:**

- Identifying when requirements are ambiguous
- Suggesting more specific language
- Pointing out potential conflicts between existing code and new requirements
- Offering templates for common request types

**Example Helpful Response:**
```
I notice you want to "implement the log panel." I see existing LogsBar code and detailed specifications in PROJECT.md. 

To ensure I build what you actually want:
- Should I enhance the existing LogsBar approach?
- Or implement the fixed-bottom panel specified in PROJECT.md?

The two approaches have different positioning, technology stacks, and user interactions.
```

## Repository-Level Files

- `PROJECT.md`: HIGH LEVEL architecture, goals, dependencies. ACTIVE project. Details of each projected stored individually in .agent_projects.
- `BACKLOG.md`: Project roadmap (names/descriptions only).
- `TODO.md`: Active TODO list
- `PROGRESS.md`: Cross-project milestones, stability metrics, architectural health.
- `DEPRECATED.md`: Auto-updated list of deprecated components.

## Project-Level Files (`.agent_projects/<project>/`)

- `PROJECT.md`: Goals, features, requirements for a single project
- `BACKLOG.md`: Story backlog.
- `TODO.md`: Task backlog.
- `STATUS.md`: Completion log, notes, test results, complexity metrics.
- `RFCs.md`: when work is completed, update RFCs.md with architectural designs for future reference.

Clean up low level details after completion of work.  Save important info in RFCs and a summary in STATUS.md.

## Extended Loop Automation & Self-Correction

Automated "Signal Collector" generates backlog tasks:

- **Test & Stability Monitoring**
    - Runs pytest suite, logs failures, flags recurring issues.

- **Dead-Code & Deprecation Detection**
    - Detect unused/deprecated code; updates DEPRECATED.md.

- **Documentation Drift Detection**
    - Detect mismatches between documentation and implementation.

- **Telemetry-Based UX Monitoring**
    - Analyze usage/error logs; flags underused/confusing features.

- **Architectural Integrity Tests**
    - Verify defined architectural boundaries.

## Priority Escalation Rules

- Tasks failing ≥3 cycles escalate to high priority.
- Stabilization Mode triggered by KPI thresholds:
    - Test pass rate < 95%
    - UX violations detected
    - Complexity trends negatively

## Testing & Quality Assurance Standards

- Behavior-driven tests auto-generated from documentation.
- Use pytest with parameterization and fixtures.
- Integration tests confirm realistic interactions.
- No tautological mocks.

Follow `TESTING.md` for execution instructions.

## Python Environment Management

- Use `uv` for virtual environments and dependency management.
- Explicitly use `python3`.
- Activate via `source .venv/bin/activate`.

## Simulated Functionality Rule

- Placeholder functionality permitted for scaffolding only.
- Replace with production implementations before marking complete.
- Flag any "Simulated" or "TODO: implement" code as incomplete.

## Fake Demo Data Prohibition

**NEVER create fake demo data for production features:**

- ❌ **Prohibited**: Fake sample logs, mock API responses, dummy data arrays
- ❌ **Prohibited**: setTimeout intervals generating fake data
- ❌ **Prohibited**: Hardcoded sample content for real application features
- ✅ **Required**: Use actual application data sources
- ✅ **Required**: Integrate with existing backend APIs and data flows
- ✅ **Required**: If no data exists, show proper empty states

**Examples of violations:**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Fake demo data
const [logs, setLogs] = useState(['Sample log 1', 'Sample log 2']);
setInterval(() => addLog('Fake message'), 5000);

// ✅ CORRECT - Real data sources  
const logs = useBackendLogs(); // From actual backend
const logs = applicationState.logEntries; // From real app state
```

**When implementing features that display data:**
1. Identify the real data source first
2. If data source doesn't exist, create it properly
3. Connect to actual backend APIs or application state
4. Show appropriate loading/empty states for real scenarios
